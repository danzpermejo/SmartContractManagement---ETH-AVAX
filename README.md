# Module 2 | Smart Contract Management - ETH + AVAX

While MetaMask isn't for directly controlling smart contracts, it acts as a bridge. You connect it to dApps (applications built on blockchain technology) that use smart contracts. MetaMask lets you see what the dApp wants to do and securely confirm or reject these actions, essentially giving you control over your interaction with smart contracts.

## Description

My smart contract empowers you to manage your ETH conveniently through MetaMask. Deposit ETH directly from your wallet and withdraw it back with ease. This secure smart contract ensures transparent transactions on the blockchain, giving you complete control over your funds.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* I cloned the github repo to and follow the instructions from the readme file.

### Executing program

* To run the program, first I add or create a network in metamask that I named it Localhost 8545.
* Lastly I copied my ip address from vs code terminal and pasted it from the network I created.
* Also to have an ETH I copied the private key from the account 0 in my vs code so that my metamask wallet have an ETH and I successfully connect it.
